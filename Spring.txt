1. What is Spring Framework - 

    Spring is a Java Framework which is used for building enterprises level applications

    It Reduces the boiler plate code

    Makes application loosely coupled

    Supports various modules like Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring AOP, Spring Security etc

2. Inversion of Control (IoC) -

    It is a principle where the control of creating and managing objects is given to the Spring container
    instead of developer manually creating them

        W/O IoC ( Traditionally ) -

            Car car = new Car("Toyota") - Tight Coupling
        
        With IoC - 

            @Component
            Class car{
                private final Engine engine
                public Car ( Engine engine ){
                    this.engine=engine
                }
            }

            * Here Spring creates Engine and injects into car

3. IoC Container -

    This is the Heart of Spring Framework and is responsible for managing the Lifecycle of Java objects,
    known as Beans

    It instantiates objects (Beans)

    Manages their Lifecycle

    Injects Dependencies

    These are of two types -

        Bean Factory Level
        ApplicationContext Level

4. Spring Beans -

    A Bean is simply a Java object that is managed by Spring IoC Container

    * Not all Java objects are Beans, only those that Spring manages and instantiates

4. Dependency Injection (DI) -

    It is a Design pattern where Spring injects required dependencies into a class instead of the class
    creating them

    These are of three types -

        Constructor Injection - 

            package com.ravi.spring;

            import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

                @Component
                public class Car {

                    private final Battery battery;

                    // Constructor Injection
                    public Car(Battery battery) {
                        this.battery = battery;
                    }

                    public void start() {
                        battery.supplyPower();
                        System.out.println("Car started");
                    }
                }

            * @Autowired is optional here because Spring auto-wires the only constructor.

        Setter Injection - 

            @Component
            public class Car {

                private Battery battery;

                // Setter Injection
                @Autowired
                public void setBattery(Battery battery) {
                    this.battery = battery;
                }

                public void start() {
                    battery.supplyPower();
                    System.out.println("Car started");
                }
            }
            
        Field Injection - 

            @Component
            public class Car {

                // Field Injection
                @Autowired
                private Battery battery;

                public void start() {
                    battery.supplyPower();
                    System.out.println("Car started");
                }
            }

    * Real World Analogy -

        Constructor Injection	

            Battery is installed before the car is assembled	
            Must-have parts like Engine, Tyres

        Setter Injection	

            Battery is installed before delivery, can be changed	
            Optional features like Music system, Dashboard camera

        Field Injection	

            Battery is sealed inside the car, cannot replace easily
        
    *   Use constructor injection + final for required dependencies
        Use setter injection for optional or late-bound dependencies
        Avoid field injection in real-world, testable codebases

5. Spring Configuration Types -

    XML-based Configuration -

        Earlier versions of Spring uses XML Configuration to define beans (objects) and manage dependency
        injections

        Key XML Tags -

            <bean>	- 
                
                Defines a Spring bean (object)

            id	
                Unique name for the bean

            class	

                Fully qualified class name

            <property>	

                Used for setter injection

            ref	

                Refers to another bean (used inside property)

            value	

                Injects a literal value

            <constructor-arg>	

                Used for constructor injection

        example -

            Constructor Injection

                package com.ravi.spring;

                    public class Processor {
                        public void performComputation() {
                            System.out.println("Processor is performing computation...");
                        }
                    }

                package com.ravi.spring;

                    public class Laptop {
                        private Processor processor;
                        private String modelName;

                        public Laptop(Processor processor, String modelName) {
                            this.processor = processor;
                            this.modelName = modelName;
                        }

                        public void run() {
                            processor.performComputation();
                            System.out.println("Laptop model: " + modelName + " is running...");
                        }
                    }

                XML Configuration - 

                    <!-- Processor Bean -->
                    <bean id="ProcessorBean" class="com.ravi.spring.Processor"/>

                    <!-- Laptop Bean using constructor injection -->
                    <bean id="LaptopBean" class="com.ravi.spring.Laptop">
                        <constructor-arg ref="ProcessorBean"/>
                        <constructor-arg value="Dell Inspiron"/>
                    </bean>

            Setter Injection -

                package com.ravi.spring;

                    public class Laptop {
                        private Processor processor;
                        private String modelName;

                        public void setProcessor(Processor processor) {
                            this.processor = processor;
                        }

                        public void setModelName(String modelName) {
                            this.modelName = modelName;
                        }

                        public void run() {
                            processor.performComputation();
                            System.out.println("Laptop model: " + modelName + " is running...");
                        }
                    }

                XML Configuration -

                    <bean id="LaptopBean" class="com.ravi.spring.Laptop">
                        <property name="processor" ref="ProcessorBean"/>
                        <property name="modelName" value="Dell Inspiron"/>
                    </bean>

    Annotation-based Configuration -

        It uses Java Annotations to define and inject beans, no spring.xml needed

        @Component	

            Marks a class as a Spring-managed bean

        @Controller	

            Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller

        @Service	

            Marks a service layer bean (semantic)

        @Repository	

            Marks a DAO layer bean (adds exception translation)

        @Configuration	

            Declares a Java class that defines Spring beans

        @Bean	

            Declares a bean method inside a config class
            
            * It is used to manually create a bean when you don't control the source code or want to
              pass constructor arguments

                Suppose you have third-party class that you cannot annotate with @Component, 
                for example:

                    public class EmailService {
                        private String smtpServer;

                        public EmailService(String smtpServer) {
                            this.smtpServer = smtpServer;
                        }

                        public void send(String to, String message) {
                            System.out.println("Sending email to " + to + " via " + smtpServer);
                        }
                    }

                    @Configuration
                        public class AppConfig {

                            @Bean
                            public EmailService emailService() {
                                return new EmailService("smtp.gmail.com");
                            }
                        }

                    @Component
                    public class NotificationService {

                        private EmailService emailService;

                        @Autowired // constructor injection
                        public NotificationService(EmailService emailService){
                            this.emailService=emailService
                        }
                        
                        public void notifyUser() {
                            emailService.send("user@example.com", "Welcome!");
                        }
                    }

        @ComponentScan	

            Tells Spring where to look for @Component classes

        @Autowired	

            Automatically injects a bean by type

        @Qualifier	

            Specifies the exact bean to inject (if multiple)
            Uses classname in camelCase format

            example -
                @Qualifier("petrolEngine")

        @Primary 

            Declares the bean as Primary i.e default

        @Value	

            Injects values from properties or literals
            @Value("${db.url}") // from application.properties file
            private String url;

        @PostConstruct	

            Runs a method after the bean is initialized

        @PreDestroy	

            Runs a method before the bean is destroyed

        @PropertySource	

            Loads .properties file into Spring environment
            @PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")

        @Profile	

            Activates a bean only in specific environments
            @Profile lets you define environment-specific beans

            spring.profiles.active = dev // in application.properties
            @Profile("prod") or  @Profile("dev")

        @Scope	

            It tells Spring How many instances of beans to create and when

            singleton -
            
                Only one instance for the entire Spring container (default)	Most used in services, 
                utilities

            prototype - 	
            
                A new instance every time the bean is requested	When stateful or short-lived

            request -
            
                One instance per HTTP request	Web apps (Spring MVC)

            session	-
            
                One instance per HTTP session	Web apps (Spring MVC)

            application	-
            
                One instance per ServletContext	Web apps

            websocket -
            
                One instance per WebSocket	WebSocket apps

        * @Service, @Repository, and @Controller are specialized forms of @Component.
          They register the class as a Spring bean, add semantic meaning, and in some cases, provide extra 
          behavior.

          for example - 

            @Repository Adds exception translation — converts database-specific exceptions (like SQLException) 
            into Spring’s DataAccessException hierarchy
        
            @Controller - Internally acts as a @Component, plus enables request mapping via annotations like 
            @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.

    Java-based Configuration -

        Here we use @Configuration and @Bean to define and manage beans

    * For XML based configuration we use -

        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext( "SpringConfigFile.xml" )
    
    * For Annotations based configuration we use -

        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext( MainMethodClass.class )
        Here class is one where @Configuration is mentioned

6. Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) -

    * Spring AOP is used to add cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, or performance monitoring 
      without modifying the actual business logic. 
      
    * It allows us to inject custom code before, after, or around method executions using annotations 
      like @Before, @After, @Around, etc

    * AOP Cocepts -

        | Term                              | Simple Definition                                                                                    | Example                                                              |
        | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) | A way to write code for tasks like logging, security, etc., separately from main business logic.     | Add logging to every service method without editing each method. |
        | Aspect                            | A class where your cross-cutting logic (like logging) lives.                                         | `LoggingAspect` class                                                |
        | Advice                            | The code you want to run before/after/around a method.                                               | `@Before` advice logs method name before it's called.                |
        | Join Point                        | A specific point in the code like a method call where advice can be applied.                         | `getUser()` method in `UserService`                                  |
        | Pointcut                          | A rule or expression that tells where the advice should apply.                                       | `execution(* com.ravi.service.*.*(..))`                              |
        | Weaving                           | The process of injecting advice into target methods during runtime.                                  | Spring uses proxies to do this.                                      |

    * execution(* com.ravi.annotation..*(..)) 

            @Pointcut("execution (* com.ravi.annotation..*(..))")
            public void allMethodsInPackage() {
            }

        Here - 

            * means any return type 
                void , String anything

            com.ravi.annotation.. means the base package and its sub-packages
                .. double dot means match any class inside this package and sub-package 
                com.ravi.annotation.Aspect
                com.ravi.annotation.Controller
                com.ravi.annotation.Car.PetrolEngine

            * means any method name
                startEngine, stopEngine etc

            (..) means any number of arguments and of any type
                (*, String) – method with 2 arguments, first any type, second must be String
        
    * Custom annotations (basic idea) -

        Create Annotation -

            package com.ravi.annotation;

            import java.lang.annotation.*;

            @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
            @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
            public @interface Loggable {
            }

        Use Annotation - 

            @Component
            public class Car {
                
                @Loggable
                public void drive() {
                    System.out.println("Driving...");
                }
            }

        Create Aspect -

            @Before("@annotation(com.ravi.annotation.Loggable)")
            public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
                System.out.println("Method called: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
            }

        Enable AOP and Component Scanning -

            @Configuration
            @ComponentScan("com.ravi")
            @EnableAspectJAutoProxy

7. Spring AOP Logging -

    * Springboot by default provides SLF4J ( Simple Logging Facade for Java ) and Logback for Logging activities

    * In Springboot application.properties file is used to configure the Logging details whereas for core
      Spring application we need to use logback.xml 

    * For core Spring application we need to manually add SLF4J and Logback dependencies

    * For Springboot we define every thing in application.properties file

        logging.file.name=logs/app.log
        logging.logback.rollingpolicy.file-name-pattern=logs/app-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.log
        logging.logback.rollingpolicy.max-file-size=10MB
        logging.logback.rollingpolicy.max-history=30

    * For Spring Core - 

        Packages Required -

            spring-aop ->

            aspectjrt ->

                Required for getting annotations like @Aspect, @Before etc

            slf4j-api ->

                Logging API interface.
                You use LoggerFactory.getLogger() and logger.info() in your Java code

            logback-classic -> 

                This is the logging backend implementation

            spring-webmvc -> 

                Enables you to build RESTful web applications with Spring Core.
                Provides DispatcherServlet, @RestController, @GetMapping, @RequestMapping, etc

            jakarta.servlet-api ->

                Required for working with servlet containers like Tomcat.
                Provides HttpServletRequest, ServletContext, etc.
                scope=provided: Because the server (Tomcat, Jetty) provides it at runtime.

            <packaging>war</packaging> - 

                WAR packaging indicates you're building a web archive to be deployed to a servlet 
                container (like Tomcat).
                
                Needed when using WebApplicationInitializer and DispatcherServlet manually 
                (i.e., not using Spring Boot)

    * Spring MVC (Traditional) vs Spring Boot ( MVC )

        Spring -
            
            Requires external Tomcat or other servlet containers.
            Application is packaged as a WAR (.war) file.
            WAR is deployed manually to a servlet container (like tomcat:10-jdk17 in Docker).
            Servlet container must be managed and configured separately.
            Docker deployment requires a Tomcat base image.
            Common use in legacy or enterprise apps.
        
        Spring Boot -

            Comes with an embedded Tomcat (default), no need for external server.
            Application is packaged as a JAR (.jar) file.
            Run directly using java -jar app.jar.
            Docker deployment is simpler using a Java base image (e.g., openjdk:17).
            Easy to configure and production-ready out of the box.
            Supports replacing Tomcat with Jetty or Undertow if needed.

8. * Spring Web MVC -

    Traditional Servlet Development (with Tomcat)

        In this case, you’re working directly with Jakarta Servlet API.

        Typical steps:
        
            Use @WebServlet("/hello") to map a URL.
            Create a class extending HttpServlet.
            Override methods like doGet() or doPost().

        example -

            @WebServlet("/hello")
            public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
                @Override
                protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
                    resp.getWriter().write("Hello from Servlet");
                }
            }

    Spring Core with Servlet API (Without Spring Boot)

        Spring doesn't use @WebServlet directly (unless you're doing very low-level integration).
        Instead, it uses:
        A configuration class like WebConfig
        A DispatcherServlet (core part of Spring MVC)
        Mappings like @RequestMapping instead of doGet() or doPost()

        example -

        public class WebAppInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer {
            @Override
            public void onStartup(ServletContext servletContext) throws ServletException {
                // Create Spring application context
                AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();
                context.register(WebConfig.class); // Register config class
                
                // Create and register DispatcherServlet
                DispatcherServlet dispatcherServlet = new DispatcherServlet(context);
                ServletRegistration.Dynamic registration = servletContext.addServlet("dispatcher", dispatcherServlet);
                
                registration.setLoadOnStartup(1); // Load servlet on app startup
                registration.addMapping("/");     // Map to root URL
                    }
                }

    ** What WebApplicationInitializer does 
        
        Create Spring application context
        Register config class
        Create and register DispatcherServlet
        Load servlet on app startup
        Map to root URL

    What WebConfig does:

        DispatcherServlet is registered via WebApplicationInitializer (or Boot).
        DispatcherServlet intercepts all HTTP requests → forwards to controllers.
        WebConfig (with @EnableWebMvc and @ComponentScan) tells Spring where to find controllers, services, etc.
        WebConfig customizes MVC infrastructure → ViewResolvers, HandlerMappings, Formatters, Interceptors, etc.
        So it can detect your @Controller, @Service, etc.
        Adds ViewResolvers, HandlerMappings, and other MVC infrastructure.

    * DispatcherServlet replaces the need for @WebServlet.

    * Spring handles request routing based on annotations like @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, etc.

    * The WebAppInitializer + WebConfig combo plays the role of both the web.xml and servlet mapping 
        config.

    ** DispatcherServlet processes all the incoming HTTP Requests and forwards it to correct 
        controller/method
        It is like Receptionist
        In Spring MVC we have only one servlet which handles everything i.e DispatcherServlet

    * In tradional servlets application where we were using Tomcat and @webservlet(path)
        here we have to create multiple servlets to serve different urls say /products /users etc 
        but with Spring MVC we can do it in one servlet using @Requestmapping and single Dispatcher 
        Servlet is used

    * Filters - 

        Filters are Java Classes that implements javax.servlet.Filter interface

        They are executed before the request reaches DispatcherServlet

        Client -> Filter(s) -> DispatcherServlet -> Controller -> View

        FilterRegistration.Dynamic filterRegistration = servletContext.addFilter("myLoggingFilter", new LoggingFilter());
        filterRegistration.addMappingForUrlPatterns(null, false, "/*");

    * Serving JSP -

        For serving JSP files we need to configure JSP resolver in WebConfig file
        ** Need to use @Controller instead of @RestController, 
            For @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody i.e return value is treated as Response body
            and not view name resolver
        
    * WebApplicationInitializer vs @WebFilter -
        
        * When we create filter in Spring MVC it is managed by the Tomcat and not by Spring
            Since A Servlet Filter is created by the servlet container (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.), not by Spring.
            So when we try to use 
            public class MyFilter implements Filter {
                @Autowired
                private UserService user_service;

            }   

            Here user_service is always null since it not managed by Spring
        
            So we use DelegatingFilterProxy which calls Tomcat proxy, proxy looks for spring managed bean
            then it delegates that request to that bean which is fully managed by Spring

        For core Spring MVC we register servlet by implementing WebApplicationInitializer

        * This is managed by Servlet and not by Spring context so we cannot use @Autowired here

        * To bridge the gap between Servlet and Spring context we can use 

            // Register filter that delegates to Spring bean
            FilterRegistration.Dynamic filter = servletContext.addFilter("myFilter",
            new DelegatingFilterProxy("myFilter")); // matches @Component name 

        ** @WebFilter is a servlet-standard way to register filters outside of Spring.
            Use it only in Spring Boot with @ServletComponentScan, or in plain servlet apps.
            In Spring MVC (non-Boot), use DelegatingFilterProxy to get full Spring support (@Autowired, etc.).

    * Request Flow in Spring MVC -

        Browser (HTTP Request)
        ↓
        Servlet Container (Tomcat / Jetty / etc.)
                ↓
        [1] Filters (e.g. Auth, Logging, CORS)
                ↓
        [2] DispatcherServlet (Spring’s Front Controller)
                ↓
        [3] HandlerMapping (Which controller to call?)
                ↓
        [4] Controller (Your @RestController or @Controller)
                ↓
        [5] Return response → ViewResolver or ResponseBody
                ↓
        Back through Filters
                ↓
        Back to Client

9. Exception Handling in Spring MVC - 
        
    * @ControllerAdvice is used to create Global exception handler

    * @ExceptionHandler(SomeException.class) will catch that exception whenever it’s thrown in any 
      controller 

10. Json Web Token's ( JWT's ) -

    * Spring package used - java-jwt

    * JWT -  <Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>

            Header: Algorithm and token type.

            Payload: Claims (data like userId, role, etc.).

            Signature: HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)

    * public class JwtUtils {

        private final static String secret_key = "my_secret_key";

        public static String generateJwtToken(String username) {

            return JWT.create().withSubject(username).withIssuedAt(new Date())
                    .withExpiresAt(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 10 * 60 * 1000)) // 10 minutes
                    .sign(Algorithm.HMAC256(secret_key));

        }

        public static String validateToken(String token) {

            try {
                DecodedJWT jwt = JWT.require(Algorithm.HMAC256(secret_key)).build().verify(token);

                return jwt.getSubject();
            } catch (JWTVerificationException e) {
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());
                return null;
            }
        }
    }

    * Register the JWTFilter in ApplicationInitializer just like DispatcherServlet,
        inside JWTFilter check and validate the token using JwtUtils.valdiateToken
        
11. Response Entity Object - 
    
    * ResponseEntity - 
        
        It is used to return response with more control
        ResponseEntity<String> response = new ResponseEntity<>(body, headers, status);

        * We can have custom Response entity with predefined DTO as well 

            ResponseEntity<ResponseMap<String>> response = new ResponseEntity<>(body, headers, status);
            where ResponseMap<T> is itself a class 
                class ResponseMap<T>{
                    private boolean success;
                    private boolean error;
                    private String message;
                    private T data; 
                }

12. Summary of Servlets & Spring Web MVC -

    🔹 Traditional Servlets

        To handle a request:

        Create a class that extends HttpServlet.

        Map it using @WebServlet("/path") or in web.xml.

        For multiple URLs → multiple servlet classes.

        To forward to JSP/another servlet → use RequestDispatcher.

        request.getRequestDispatcher("page.jsp").forward(request, response);

        Lifecycle (creation, init, service, destroy) is container-managed (Tomcat/Jetty).

    🔹 Spring MVC

        Instead of many servlets, you just need one DispatcherServlet.

        This DispatcherServlet is registered in Java config using WebApplicationInitializer (no @WebServlet required).

        Create an AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext.

        Register your @Configuration (WebConfig).

        Register the DispatcherServlet and map it to /.

        public class MyWebAppInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer {
            @Override
            public void onStartup(ServletContext servletContext) {
                AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();
                context.register(WebConfig.class);

                ServletRegistration.Dynamic dispatcher =
                        servletContext.addServlet("dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(context));
                dispatcher.setLoadOnStartup(1);
                dispatcher.addMapping("/");
            }
        }

        WebConfig (with @EnableWebMvc + @ComponentScan) tells Spring where controllers/services are.

        No need for multiple servlets → all requests go through the single DispatcherServlet.

        Mapped to methods using @Controller + @RequestMapping.

    🔹 Filters in Spring

        If you need a filter that depends on Spring beans (@Autowired), you cannot let Tomcat create it.

        Use DelegatingFilterProxy → Tomcat calls the proxy, proxy delegates to the Spring-managed filter.

        Example: springSecurityFilterChain, JWT authentication filters, logging filters with DI.
