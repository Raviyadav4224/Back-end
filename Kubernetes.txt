1. Kubernetes - 

    * It is a container orchestration tool used for managing, scaling and deploying containerized based
      applications.

2. Pods -

    * It is the smallest deployable unit

    * Runs one container ( say one microservice )

    * It is Ephemeral i.e its IP changes on restart

3. Deployment -

    * Manages the pods, Ensures desired no of replicas, handles Scaling, Restart on Crash, rolling
      upates etc

4. Service -

    * It sits infront of Deployment i.e One service per deployment

    * It is used to provide stable network endpoint infront of pods

    * It provides DNS name, Load balancing and decouples client from PODs ip's

    * Service Types -

        * ClusterIp (default) -

            Used for internal service communication
        
        * NodePort -

            Exposes service on <NodeIP>:port
        
        * Load balancer -

            Creates cloud load balancer and Works in cloud only (AWS, GCP etc)
        
        * ExternalName -

            Maps services to external DNS

5. Ingress -

    * Entry point into the Cluster

    * Routes HTTP/HTTPS traffics

    * Talks to services and not pods

    * Handles path/host based routing

6. Networking -

7. Service Discovery -

    * Kubernetes provides built in service discovery using Service and DNS

    * It replaces the need of Eureka Server 

8. Config Maps & Secrets -

    * These are used to store Application configs and secrets and are injected as environment variables
