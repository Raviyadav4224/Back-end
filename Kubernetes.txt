1. Kubernetes - 

    * It is a container orchestration tool used for managing, scaling and deploying containerized based
      applications.

2. Pods -

    * It is the smallest deployable unit

    * Runs one container ( say one microservice )

    * It is Ephemeral i.e its IP changes on restart

3. Deployment -

    * Manages the pods, Ensures desired no of replicas, handles Scaling, restart on Crash, rolling
      upates etc

4. Service -

    * It sits infront of Deployment i.e One service per deployment

    * It is used to provide stable network endpoint infront of pods

    * It provides DNS name, Load balancing and decouples client from PODs ip's

    * Service Types -

        * ClusterIp (default) -

            Used for internal service communication
        
        * NodePort -

            Exposes service on <NodeIP>:port
        
        * Load balancer -

            Creates cloud load balancer and Works in cloud only (AWS, GCP etc)
        
        * ExternalName -

            Maps services to external DNS

5. Ingress -

    * Entry point into the Cluster

    * Routes HTTP/HTTPS traffics

    * Talks to services and not pods

    * Handles path/host based routing

6. Networking -

7. Service Discovery -

    * Kubernetes provides built in service discovery using Service and DNS

    * It replaces the need of Eureka Server 

8. Config Maps & Secrets -

    * These are used to store Application configs and secrets and are injected as environment variables
    
    * Secret.yaml file is encrypted wheareas configmap.yaml is not encrypted
    
9. Kubernetes deployment steps -


    * We first create NAMESPACE = Folder inside Kubernetes Cluster

    * To deploy an application using Kubernetes we create four files -

        1. deployment.yaml 

            Runs your Docker image as Pods (your application)
            
        2. service.yaml

            Gives network access inside cluster (DNS name)
           
        3. configmap.yaml

            Stores normal environment variables

        4. secret.yaml

            Stores sensitive values (passwords, JWT keys, etc.)
